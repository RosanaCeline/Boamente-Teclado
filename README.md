# Changelog

This is a project based on the original version of [AnySoftKeyboard](https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard), but with specific modifications. This document highlights the key modifications made to the project. The original README is still available in this repository and can be found by clicking [here](./original_readme/README.md).
